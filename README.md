# Pong Java

This repository contains files for my personal recreation of the popular web-based game, Pong. I created it so that the game can be played by 2 players, each controlling their respective paddle. It is a fairly simple game to pick up. Player 1 controls the paddle on the left of the screen, using the 'W' and 'S' keys to move the paddle up & down respectively.
