# Pong Java

This repository contains files for my personal recreation of the popular web-based game, Pong. I created it so that the game can be played by 2 players, each controlling their respective paddle. It is a fairly simple game to pick up. Player 1 controls the paddle on the left of the screen, using the 'W' and 'S' keys to move the paddle up & down respectively. Player 2 controls the paddle on the right of the screen, using the up & down arrow keys. The ball's speed as well as x & y directions are randomized to make the game more challenging and enjoyable for the users.
